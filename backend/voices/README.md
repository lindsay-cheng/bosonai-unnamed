# Voice Reference Audio Files

This directory should contain 3 reference audio files for voice cloning:

## Required Files:

1. **dragon.wav** - Bold, confident, inspiring voice
   - Sample text: "Greetings, I am Dragon, the bold visionary. Let's explore the possibilities together and claim our destiny."
   
2. **ox.wav** - Calm, methodical, steady voice
   - Sample text: "Hello, I'm Ox, the patient guardian. Let me consider this carefully with steady wisdom."
   
3. **monkey.wav** - Quick, playful, energetic voice
   - Sample text: "Hey there, I'm Monkey, the clever trickster. Ready for something fun and unexpected?"

## How to Generate These Files:

### Option 1: Use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (Recommended for demo)
- Pick 3 different neural voices with distinct personalities
- Generate 10-30 second samples
- Export as WAV files

### Option 2: Use ElevenLabs
- Create character voices matching the personalities
- Generate samples with the text above

### Option 3: Record Your Own
- Use Audacity or any recording software
- Record yourself speaking with different tones for each character
- Export as WAV files

## File Format:
- Format: WAV
- Duration: 10-30 seconds
- Sample rate: 16kHz or higher
- Mono or Stereo (BosonAI handles both)
